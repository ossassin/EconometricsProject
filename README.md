# Econometrics Project
In this course project, along with my group members, we looked into the relationship of CO2 emissions and GDP per Capita of economies in Asia. 
The phenomenon under investigation was called Environmental Kuznet Curve, which hypothesizes enivornment degradation increases as GDP per capita increases.
Once it reaches a turning point, the enivornmental degradation begins to fall as GDP per capita increases. You can read up more about it here:

In this repository, I've added the data file that I created from https://data.worldbank.org. 
You can read up on the report for the project submission for more details on our team's execution. The script file written in R is also present.

Thank you for checking out my profile! Hope you have a nice day :D
